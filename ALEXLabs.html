   <h1 style="color:orange; font-size:35pt;">ALEX Labs</h1> 

  <p style="color:white; font-size:18pt;">Welcome to <span style="color:orange;">Astronomy Laboratory Exercises and eXperiments (ALEX)</span>! These experiments were originally designed for the use of University of Florida Astronomy 1022L course. <br><br> 

  These labs are inspired by the Contemporary Lab Experiences in Astronomy (CLEA) Labs created by Gettysburg College. Those labs had been in use by the Florida Astronomy department for well over a decade before these labs came along. CLEA labs ceased operations around 2016. In the years following, some of the software became inoperable on UF's Windows 10 machines. <br><br>

  Seeing the writing on the wall, as well as an opportunity to improve upon the formula these original labs had, I took it upon myself to reprogram some of these labs. The intent was to make them future-proof. To that end, I programmed these labs in HTML/Javascript (as you can see). I make no claims of being an expert at either of these languages, but these labs are in a more stable place than when I started my TA position for this course. <br><br>

  The two labs that I have programmed thus far (and may be the only ones, yet to be seen) are <span style="color:blue;">You Can Weigh Jupiter</span> and <span style="color:green">Astronomical Spectroscopy II</span> (based on "The Flow Of Energy Out Of The Sun" by CLEA). <br>
  </p>

  <h2 style="color:blue; font-size:24pt;">You Can Weigh Jupiter</h2>

  <p style="font-size:18pt;">Have you ever wondered how Astronomers know how much the planets weigh? Well wonder no more! This lab explores the motions of Jupiter's most famous moons: Io, Europa, Callisto and Ganymede. <br><br>
  
  Watch and measure as the moons orbit around Jupiter. With the measurements of the size of the orbits, their timing, and knowledge of Kepler's Laws, we can ascertain the mass of Jupiter!
  </p>

  <h2 style="color:green; font-size:24pt">Astronomical Spectroscopy II</h2>

  <p style="color:#478778; font-size:18pt;">Have you ever wondered by visible light is visible? How about why does the Sun appears yellow? <br><br>

  The answers lie in Spectroscopy and Blackbody radiation, the subjects of this lab. In this lab, we predict what the temperature of the Sun is and what it is made of. This lab, a digital follow-up to the physical lab Astronomical Spectroscopy I, provides theoretical background through the example of the Sun.
