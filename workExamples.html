  <h1>Graduate Research</h1>
  
  <p>I am working with Paul Torrey this summer (2021) and as I transition into graduate school at UF.<br><br> My work is with the Illustris TNG simulation data, specifically I am looking at median metallicty profiles of TNG50 subhalos binned by mass. What I am trying to determine is the 'break radius', the radius at which the metallicity floor begins to be reached, of each subhalo. These median profiles were created for bins with width log stellar mass 0.5 with startpoints ranging from 9.0 - 10.9 log stellar mass. An example of these median profiles can be seen in the plot below, plotted with one standard deviation shaded in. </p>

  <img src="./ResearchRelated/Graduate/TNG50bins1.png" class="center" height=33% width=33%>

  <p>After creating these individual profiles for each bin, I devised a method to fit the profiles with a two-component linear fit. This method involved a brute-force optimization of chi-squared values on linear regressions at all possible breaks along the profile. The python scripts for the two-component fitting can be found <a href="./ResearchRelated/Graduate/twoCompLR.html" target="_blank">here</a>. One constraint that I added to retreive better fits for the profiles was force all of the regressions to be at least 2 kpc long. Another issue that I ran into while creating these fits was where to start and stop our search area. The noise at the beginning of the profiles and at the end cause some difficulty within the fitting routine. My solution for the startpoints was the trim out the first 5% of the star forming gas in the profiles. For the endpoints, I used 15 + 7.5*binNumber to set the end of the fits.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Three Example fits for the two-component linear regression, as you can see, we had varying degrees of success with fitting these profiles with only a single break.</p>

  <p>I created these fits for all of the different mass bins and created a plot of the break radius as a function of mass. Several of the higher mass bins had very few subhalos and thus the data were more noisy and less well-constrained for the fitting routine, so I created a second plot omitting these. As seen below, the break radius and log mass follow a linear relationship. </p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>With this linear relationship between the break and mass of the subhalos demonstrated, the next step was to see if a three-component linear regression would describe our profiles better. This <a href="./ResearchRelated/Graduate/threeCompLR.html" target="_blank">three-component linear regression</a> was just an extension of the two-component linear regression. It optimized the chi-squared of all three lines it fit, simultaneously.</p>

  <h2>Walk-in Tutoring</h2>
  <p>CARE hosts daily tutoring sessions, typically from noon to midnight, where any student can come into our walk-in space and ask questions. Tutors are rotated in and out during these times and can answer questions on a myriad of different topics. During my time as a CARE tutor, I was able to answer questions on the courses found <a href="courses.html">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>Exam Review Sessions </h2>
  <p>In addition to walk-in tutoring, CARE hosts exam-review sessions for a number of different freshman- and sophomore-level courses. These events are office hours sytle: two hours in length where students can come and ask a small team of tutors any questions about what they are working on in a particular course. <br><br>

During the summer before my senior year of undergrad, I aided in creating new worksheets for the University of Illinois' College of Engineering's tutoring center. All the worksheets were created in LaTeX and maintained by myself and others during the school year. <a href="./pdfs/worksheets.html">Here</a> are some of the worksheets as they were in May of 2021.</p>

  <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
  <p>During my tenure as a tutor with CARE, I also looked at the traffic patterns of our walk-in tutoring center. I assembled these reports using python and LaTeX and preseneted them monthly, as well as every semseter, to the entire team. <a href="./pdfs/walkinReports.html" target="_blank">Here</a> are a couple of reports.</p>

<section id="Undergraduate Research">
  <h1>Undergraduate Research</h1>

  <p>During my time at Illinois, I participated with two research groups: Professor Bryan Dunne's and Professor Yue Shen's. I started with Professor Dunne in the fall semester of my senior year and with Professon Shen the spring of my senior year.</p>

  <h2>Professor Bryan Dunne</h2>

  <p>My work with Professor Dunne was focused on beginning research methods. The program was run through <a href="https://www.oursolarsiblings.com/" target="_blank">Our Solar Sibilings</a>, maintained and operated by Michael Fitzgerald, out of Melbourne Australia. The program consisted of weekly modules intended to get students familiar with the process of research. Our group, made up of three undergraduate students, worked on an observation project on variable stars of the RR Lyrae variety. Our target: V0660 Andromeda.</p>

  <p>One of the first modules had us get familiar with the photo-editing program Gimp. We chose a supernova at random, requested composite images, and stacked them together in Gimp. <a href="./images/FirstImage.png" target="_blank">Here</a> is the result. The next, and (unfortunately due to time constraints) last, step of this project was the literature review. We compiled several sources, available to see <a href="V0660_sources.html" target="_blank">here</a>. We were beginning to assemble the framework of a paper when we ran into our time constraints. <a href="./ResearchRelated/V0660_AND.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is as far as we got on the paper-writing process (admittedly, not very far).</p>

  <h2>Professor Yue Shen</h2>

  <p>My work with Professor Shen was centered on the Sloan Digitial Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 16, specifically the quasars. We wanted to analyze and get rid of a lot of the noise on the spectrum of these quasars. This project was an analysis project and more hands-on with coding than my previous experience with Professor Dunne. My small part in this project was to translate an IDL script into Python. The <a href="./ResearchRelated/synthspec_print.pdf" target="_blank">original IDL script</a> had several checks that we did not have to implement in Python. The <a href="./ResearchRelated/Project.html" target="_blank">Python Script</a>, created in a jupyter notebook, helped filter out this noise and give a much neater spectral emission line.</p>
