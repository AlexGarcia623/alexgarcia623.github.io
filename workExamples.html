  <h1>Center for Academic Resources in Engineering (CARE) UIUC</h1>

  <h2>Walk-in Tutoring</h2>
  <p>CARE hosts daily tutoring sessions, typically from noon to midnight, where any student can come into our walk-in space and ask questions. Tutors are rotated in and out during these times and can answer questions on a myriad of different topics. During my time as a CARE tutor, I was able to answer questions on the courses found <a href="courses.html">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>Exam Review Sessions </h2>
  <p>In addition to walk-in tutoring, CARE hosts exam-review sessions for a number of different freshman- and sophomore-level courses. These events are office hours sytle: two hours in length where students can come and ask a small team of tutors any questions about what they are working on in a particular course. <br><br>

During the summer before my senior year of undergrad, I aided in creating new worksheets for the University of Illinois' College of Engineering's tutoring center. All the worksheets were created in LaTeX and maintained by myself and others during the school year. <a href="./pdfs/worksheets.html">Here</a> are some of the worksheets as they were in May of 2021.</p>

  <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
  <p>During my tenure as a tutor with CARE, I also looked at the traffic patterns of our walk-in tutoring center. I assembled these reports using python and LaTeX and preseneted them monthly, as well as every semseter, to the entire team. <a href="./pdfs/walkinReports.html" target="_blank">Here</a> are a couple of reports.</p>

  <h1>Undergraduate Research</h1>

  <p>During my time at Illinois, I participated with two research groups: Professor Bryan Dunne's and Professor Yue Shen's. I started with Professor Dunne in the fall semester of my senior year and with Professon Shen the spring of my senior year.</p>

  <h2>Professor Bryan Dunne</h2>

  <p>My work with Professor Dunne was focused on beginning research methods. The program was run through <a href="https://www.oursolarsiblings.com/" target="_blank">Our Solar Sibilings</a>, maintained and operated by Michael Fitzgerald, out of Melbourne Australia. The program consisted of weekly modules intended to get students familiar with the process of research. Our group, made up of three undergraduate students, worked on an observation project on variable stars of the RR Lyrae variety. Our target: V0660 Andromeda.</p>

  <p>One of the first modules had us get familiar with the photo-editing program Gimp. We chose a supernova at random, requested composite images, and stacked them together in Gimp. <a href="./images/FirstImage.png" target="_blank">Here</a> is the result. The next, and (unfortunately due to time constraints) last, step of this project was the literature review. We compiled several sources, available to see <a href="V0660_sources.html" target="_blank">here</a>. We were beginning to assemble the framework of a paper when we ran into our time constraints. <a href="./ResearchRelated/V0660_AND.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is as far as we got on the paper-writing process (admittedly, not very far).</p>

  <h2>Professor Yue Shen</h2>

  <p>My work with Professor Shen was centered on the Sloan Digitial Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 16, specifically the quasars. We wanted to analyze and get rid of a lot of the noise on the spectrum of these quasars. This project was an analysis project and more hands-on with coding than my previous experience with Professor Dunne. My small part in this project was to translate an IDL script into Python. The <a href="./ResearchRelated/synthspec_print.pdf" target="_blank">original IDL script</a> had several checks that we did not have to implement in Python. The <a href="./ResearchRelated/Project.html" target="_blank">Python Script</a>, created in a jupyter notebook, helped filter out this noise and give a much neater spectral emission line.</p>
