  <h1>Center for Academic Resources in Engineering (CARE) UIUC</h1>

  <h2>Walk-in Tutoring</h2>
  <p>CARE hosts daily tutoring sessions, typically from noon to midnight, where any student can come into our walk-in space and ask questions. Tutors are rotated in and out during these times and can answer questions on a myriad of different topics. During my time as a CARE tutor, I was able to answer questions on the courses found <a href="courses.html">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>Exam Review Sessions </h2>
  <p>In addition to walk-in tutoring, CARE hosts exam-review sessions for a number of different freshman- and sophomore-level courses. These events are office hours sytle: two hours in length where students can come and ask a small team of tutors any questions about what they are working on in a particular course. <br><br>

During the summer before my senior year of undergrad, I aided in creating new worksheets for the University of Illinois' College of Engineering's tutoring center. All the worksheets were created in LaTeX and maintained by myself and others during the school year. <a href="./pdfs/worksheets.html">Here</a> are some of the worksheets as they were in May of 2021.

  <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
  <p>During my tenure as a tutor with CARE, I also looked at the traffic patterns of our walk-in tutoring center. I assembled these reports using python and LaTeX and preseneted them monthly, as well as every semseter, to the entire team. <a href="./pdfs/walkinReports.html">Here</a> are a couple of reports.</p>

  <h1>Classical Physics Lab (PHYS 401) </h1>
  <p>Experiments and techniques in classical mechanics and electromagnetism. Dynamics of electrical and mechanical oscillators in the linear domain. Fourier analysis of system response. Measurements of electrostatic fields, transmission lines, waves, and radiation. Electromagnetic phenomena in dielectrics, conductors, and magnetic materials. Instruction in data analysis and report writing.<br><br><a href="./pdfs/labReports.html">Click Here to see the reports</a></p>
