  <h1>Center for Academic Resources in Engineering (CARE) UIUC</h1>
  <h2>Exam Review Sessions </h2>
  <p>During the summer before my senior year of undergrad, I aided in creating new worksheets for the University of Illinois' College of Engineering's tutoring center. All the worksheets were created in LaTeX and maintained by myself and others during the school year. <a href="./pdfs/worksheets.html">Here</a> are some of the worksheets as they were in May of 2021.

  <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
  <p>During my tenure as a tutor with CARE, I also looked at the traffic patterns of our walk-in tutoring center. I assembled these reports using python and LaTeX and preseneted them monthly, as well as every semseter, to the entire team. <a href="./pdfs/walkinReports.html">Here</a> are a couple of reports.</p>

  <h1>Classical Physics Lab (PHYS 401) </h1>
