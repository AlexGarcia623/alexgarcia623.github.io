  <h1>Graduate Research</h1>
  
  <p>I am working in Paul Torrey's group at the University of Florida.<br><br> 

    My main research interests lie in cosmological simulations of the universe. I am currently using the Illustris and IllustrisTNG (The Next Generation) simulation suites to analyze metallicity gradients of simulated galaxies to measure how they vary with mass and redshift. </p>

   <h2>Project #1: Gas-Phase Metallicity Break Radii in Illustris and IllustrisTNG galaxies</h2>

   <p><em><b>Abstract:</em></b><br>We present radial gas-phase metallicity profiles, gradients, and break radii at redshift z = 0 - 3 from the TNG50-1 star-forming galaxy population. These metallicity profiles are characterized by an emphasis on identifying the steep inner gradient and flat outer gradient. From this, the break radius is defined as the region where the transition occurs. We observe the break radius having a positive trend with mass that weakens with redshift. When normalized by the stellar half-mass radius, the break radius has a weak relation with both mass and redshift. To test if our results are dependent on the resolution or adopted physics of TNG50-1, the same analysis is performed in TNG50-2 and Illustris-1. We find general agreement between each of the simulations in their qualitative trends; however, the adopted physics between TNG and Illustris differ and therefore the breaks, normalized by size, deviate by a factor of ~2. In order to understand where the break comes from, we define two relevant time-scales: an enrichment time-scale and a radial gas mixing time-scale. We find that the break radius occurs where the gas mixing time-scale is ~10 times as long as the enrichment time-scale in all three simulation runs, with some weak mass and redshift dependence.</p>

  <p>This work is in an extremely late-stage draft and should be published very soon<br><br><p>

  <p>*As the lab instructor for Astronomy 1022, I was the primary instructor for two sections of the course. Responsibilites included giving two lectures every week (one for each section), conducting experiments, grading lab reports, and managing students. </p>

  <p>**For all courses at the University of Illinois, I was employed as a Course Assistant. This title was given to undergraduates who were helping professors grade.</p> 

<h2>Astronomy 1022 Lab Textbook </h2>

  <p>During the Spring 2022 semester, I undertook the task of revising the new, tenth edition of the University Florida Astronomy 1022 textbook, "Hands-on Astronomy". This textbook functioned as a lab manual for each of the 22 different labs, all of which I had a hand in modernizing and helping overall functionality.</p>

  <p>The textbook was originally compiled in 1997 and had sparsely been updated since that time. I translated the old versions of the textbook into LaTeX, including recreating several figures with the Tikz package. These quality of life changes added a dynamic quality to the textbook that should hopefully allow the Department of Astronomy to be able to continuously edit the textbook over the years. </p>

  <p>The textbook is a required text for all students enrolled in the Astronomy 1022 lab course. To this day, students (and instructors) are still benefitting from the revisions that I implemented. This textbook is available for purchase at the <em>Target Copy</em> store on University Ave in Gainesville. Below is the first pages of the tenth edition book as they would have appeared for the Spring 2022 semester.</p>

  <h1>Kika Silva Pla Planetarium</h1>

  <p>Starting in the Fall Semester of 2021, I work at the Kika Silva Pla Planetarium at Santa Fe College in Gainesville, FL. I work there alongside James Albury, the planetarium director and <em>star</em> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JamesAlburyTheSkyAboveUs" target="_blank">"The Sky Above Us"</a> webseries.</p>

  <p>I engage in science outreach to a wide variety of audiences. The planetarium hosts weekly events on Fridays and Saturdays (starting 11/12/2021) for a series of different shows. The show topics range from educational to entertaining and all serve to get the public more interested in space and astronomy. 

  </p>

  <img src="./images/KSP.jpeg" class="center" height=100% width=70%>  

  <p>

One of the earliest projects that I worked on at KSP Planetarium was to add an accessible option for many of the shows with closed captioning. As a person with a hearing disability, this was certainly something that I felt was important that the planetarium had and something that I felt it didn't when I arrived.

<br><br>

My favorite accomplishment during my time at the Planetarium was learning to perform "Florida Skies", an hour long show giving the public a tour of the night-time sky. Within my first eight months of working at the planetarium, I was able to perform this tour with our CHRONOS-II optical-mechanical projector. </p>

<section id = "CARE">
  <h1>Center for Academic Resources in Engineering (CARE) UIUC</h1>

  <h2>My invovlement with CARE</h2>

  <p>During undergrad, I tutored for the College of Engineering. I tutored a number of different courses ranging in disciplines. During my junior year, I was appointed to the leadership team, wherein I learned valuable skills in not only science communication and presentation, but in managing a team. <br><br>

  My work as a tutor had a significant, positive impact on my fellow students. Three to four times a week for nearly 3 years, I would field many questions and help students succeed in any way that I could. I was recognized during my last semester as being honored with <a href="inTheNews.html" style="color:steelblue;">Tutor of the Year Honorable Mention</a> at the University level.
 </p>

  <h2>Walk-in Tutoring</h2>
  <p>CARE hosts daily tutoring sessions, typically from noon to midnight, where any student can come into our walk-in space and ask questions. Tutors are rotated in and out during these times and can answer questions on a myriad of different topics. <br><br> During my time as a CARE tutor, I answered questions on the following courses (courses only in College of Engineering):</p>

  <h2>Exam Review Sessions </h2>
  <p>In addition to walk-in tutoring, CARE hosts exam-review sessions for a number of different freshman- and sophomore-level courses. These events are office hours sytle: two hours in length where students can come and ask a small team of tutors any questions about what they are working on in a particular course. <br><br>

During the summer before my senior year of undergrad, I aided in creating new worksheets for the University of Illinois' College of Engineering's tutoring center. All the worksheets were created in LaTeX and maintained by myself and others during the school year. <a href="./pdfs/worksheets.html">Here</a> are some of the worksheets as they were in May of 2021. <br><br> Additionally, I created a rudimentary Tikz guide for the diagrams that I created:</p>


  <embed src="./pdfs/Tikz.pdf" class="center"/>

  <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
  <p>During my tenure as a tutor with CARE, I also looked at the traffic patterns of our walk-in tutoring center. I assembled these reports using python and LaTeX and preseneted them monthly, as well as every semseter, to the entire team. <a href="./pdfs/walkinReports.html">Here</a> are a couple of reports.</p>

  <h2>Training Oncoming and Future tutors</h2>
  <p>Additional responsibilities that I was handed as a member of the leadership team was to lead a demonstration interview for tutor applicatants as well as to document my work for future iterations of CARE. <br> <br>
  The interviews with the candidates consisted of a 25-minute process where the applicant was handed a problem from a subject of their chosing and walked us through the solution. This process was done in order to assess the applicant's ability to guide students through a problem they were having trouble with. After the demonstration, we asked applicants a series of peer advising questions to determine if they could accurately recognize signs on mental distress and recommend resources on campus to help. <br> <br>

<section id="Undergraduate Research">
  <h1>Undergraduate Research</h1>

  <p>During my time at Illinois, I participated with two research groups: Professor Bryan Dunne's and Professor Yue Shen's. I started with Professor Dunne in the fall semester of my senior year and with Professon Shen the spring of my senior year.</p>

  <h2>Professor Bryan Dunne</h2>

  <p>My work with Professor Dunne was focused on beginning research methods. The program was run through <a href="https://www.oursolarsiblings.com/" target="_blank">Our Solar Sibilings</a>, maintained and operated by Michael Fitzgerald, out of Melbourne Australia. The program consisted of weekly modules intended to get students familiar with the process of research. Our group, made up of three undergraduate students, worked on an observation project on variable stars of the RR Lyrae variety. Our target: V0660 Andromeda.</p>

  <p>One of the first modules had us get familiar with the photo-editing program <em>Gimp</em>. We chose a supernova at random, requested composite images, and stacked them together in Gimp. Below is the result. The next, and (unfortunately due to time constraints) last, step of this project was the literature review. We were beginning to assemble the framework of a paper when we ran into out of time for the project.</p>

  <img src="./images/FirstImage.png" class="center" height=100% width=70%>  

  <h2>Professor Yue Shen</h2>

  <p>My work with Professor Shen was centered on the Sloan Digitial Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 16, specifically the quasars. We wanted to analyze and get rid of a lot of the noise on the spectrum of these quasars. This project was an analysis project and more hands-on with coding than my previous experience with Professor Dunne. My small part in this project was to translate an IDL script into Python. The <a href="./ResearchRelated/Project.html" target="_blank">Python Script</a>, shown here in a jupyter notebook, helped filter out this noise and give a much neater spectral emission line.</p>
