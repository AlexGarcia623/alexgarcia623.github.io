  <h1>Graduate Research</h1>
  
  <p>I am working with Paul Torrey's group at the University of Florida.<br><br> 

    My main research interests lie in cosmological simulations of the universe. I am currently using the Illustris simulation suite to analyze metallicity gradients of simulated galaxies to measure how they vary with mass and redshift. These results then will be compared to observational data, and I will attempt to deduce how well an observational study could observe these trends, given the current paradigm. <br><br>

    My current work with Illustris is looking at median metallicty profiles of galaxies binned by mass. What I am trying to determine is the 'break radius', the radius at which the metallicity gradient transitions from steep to flat. These median profiles were created for mass bins with width 0.5 dex. An example of these median profiles can be seen in the plot below, plotted with one standard deviation shaded in. </p>

  <p> Note that this is a preliminary result and an updated version of this plot, or one similar to it, may be used in the final draft of the paper.</p>

  <p>For all courses at the University of Illinois, I was employed as a Course Assistant. This title was given to undergraduates who were helping professors grade. At the University of Florida, I was a Teaching Assistant as a part of my graduate cirriculum. The main difference between the two positions was as a Teaching Assistant I was responsible for holding office hours for students. </p>

  <h1>Kika Silva Pla Planetarium</h1>

  <p>Starting in the Fall Semester of 2021, I work at the Kika Silva Pla Planetarium at Santa Fe College in Gainesville, FL. I work there alongside James Albury, the planetarium director and star of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JamesAlburyTheSkyAboveUs" target="_blank">"The Sky Above Us"</a> youtube series.</p>

  <p>During my tenure at the planetarium, I will be actively engaging in science outreach to a wide variety of audiences, young and old. The planetarium hosts weekly events on Fridays and Saturdays (starting 11/12/2021) for a series of different shows. The show topics range from educational to entertaining and all serve to get the public more interested in space and astronomy. <br><br> Additionally, I hope to create my own full-dome planetarium show using the software on the planetarium computers in the next year or so, as well as gain enough knowledge to show "Florida Skies", our flagship production on our CHRONOS II projector, to audiences.</p>

  <p>For more information about the planetarium, including when the next shows are, please visit the <a href="https://www.sfcollege.edu/planetarium/" target="_blank">Kika Silva Pla Website</a> </p>

<section id = "CARE">
  <h1>Center for Academic Resources in Engineering (CARE) UIUC</h1>

  <h2>Walk-in Tutoring</h2>
  <p>CARE hosts daily tutoring sessions, typically from noon to midnight, where any student can come into our walk-in space and ask questions. Tutors are rotated in and out during these times and can answer questions on a myriad of different topics. During my time as a CARE tutor, I was able to answer questions on the courses found <a href="courses.html">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>Exam Review Sessions </h2>
  <p>In addition to walk-in tutoring, CARE hosts exam-review sessions for a number of different freshman- and sophomore-level courses. These events are office hours sytle: two hours in length where students can come and ask a small team of tutors any questions about what they are working on in a particular course. <br><br>

During the summer before my senior year of undergrad, I aided in creating new worksheets for the University of Illinois' College of Engineering's tutoring center. All the worksheets were created in LaTeX and maintained by myself and others during the school year. <a href="./pdfs/worksheets.html">Here</a> are some of the worksheets as they were in May of 2021.</p>

  <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
  <p>During my tenure as a tutor with CARE, I also looked at the traffic patterns of our walk-in tutoring center. I assembled these reports using python and LaTeX and preseneted them monthly, as well as every semseter, to the entire team. <a href="./pdfs/walkinReports.html" target="_blank">Here</a> are a couple of reports.</p>

  <h2>Training Oncoming and Future tutors</h2>
  <p>Additional responsibilities that I was handed as a member of the leadership team was to lead a demonstration interview for tutor applicatants as well as to document my work for future iterations of CARE. <br> <br>
  The interviews with the candidates consisted of a 25-minute process where the applicant was handed a problem from a subject of their chosing and walked us through the solution. This process was done in order to assess the applicant's ability to guide students through a problem they were having trouble with. After the demonstration, we asked applicants a series of peer advising questions to determine if they could accurately recognize signs on mental distress and recommend resources on campus to help. <br> <br>
  During my tenure on the leadership team, I was, as mentioned above, in charge of several different projects in improving the tutoring center. As such, as I was preparing to leave the university, I created several documents recording exactly how I performed certain technical aspects of the projects. Most noteably my work with <a href="./pdfs/Tikz.pdf" target="_blank">LaTeX (especially Tikz)</a> on our exam review worksheets and my <a href="./pdfs/PyCARE.html" target="_blank">python routine</a> to analyze the walk-in data.

<section id="Undergraduate Research">
  <h1>Undergraduate Research</h1>

  <p>During my time at Illinois, I participated with two research groups: Professor Bryan Dunne's and Professor Yue Shen's. I started with Professor Dunne in the fall semester of my senior year and with Professon Shen the spring of my senior year.</p>

  <h2>Professor Bryan Dunne</h2>

  <p>My work with Professor Dunne was focused on beginning research methods. The program was run through <a href="https://www.oursolarsiblings.com/" target="_blank">Our Solar Sibilings</a>, maintained and operated by Michael Fitzgerald, out of Melbourne Australia. The program consisted of weekly modules intended to get students familiar with the process of research. Our group, made up of three undergraduate students, worked on an observation project on variable stars of the RR Lyrae variety. Our target: V0660 Andromeda.</p>

  <p>One of the first modules had us get familiar with the photo-editing program Gimp. We chose a supernova at random, requested composite images, and stacked them together in Gimp. <a href="./images/FirstImage.png" target="_blank">Here</a> is the result. The next, and (unfortunately due to time constraints) last, step of this project was the literature review. We compiled several sources, available to see <a href="V0660_sources.html" target="_blank">here</a>. We were beginning to assemble the framework of a paper when we ran into our time constraints. <a href="./ResearchRelated/V0660_AND.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is as far as we got on the paper-writing process (admittedly, not very far).</p>

  <h2>Professor Yue Shen</h2>

  <p>My work with Professor Shen was centered on the Sloan Digitial Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 16, specifically the quasars. We wanted to analyze and get rid of a lot of the noise on the spectrum of these quasars. This project was an analysis project and more hands-on with coding than my previous experience with Professor Dunne. My small part in this project was to translate an IDL script into Python. The <a href="./ResearchRelated/synthspec_print.pdf" target="_blank">original IDL script</a> had several checks that we did not have to implement in Python. The <a href="./ResearchRelated/Project.html" target="_blank">Python Script</a>, created in a jupyter notebook, helped filter out this noise and give a much neater spectral emission line.</p>
